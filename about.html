                                and the BGHS have legal tenure.

                                Iris Stephenson (nee Bowden) lived in this cottage as a young girl.  She tells of
                                how her family came to the Gawler / Barossa Goldfields area and how they made Bowden's Cottage
                                their home.  Iris's parents, Jack and Vera Bowden were pioneers.  Her mother was a nursing
                                sister in Sydney and met her husband (Iris's father) after the Boer war.  She decided to leave
                                Sydney, marry this man and join him on Paratoo Station on the Broken Hill Line.  Her fellow
                                nursing friends gave her six weeks in the bush but even after 40 years she never looked back.
                                Life in the bush was nothing but hard work and struggle.  Iris's mother had 3 other children,
                                2 girls and a boy, but Iris was a late comer, "an afterthought".  It was a harsh upbringing,
                                with much hard work and heartache; little food, no electricity, and no running water but,
                                despite the hardships, Iris recalls a contented life.  When Iris's father was injured in a
                                horse and cart accident his legs were crushed and he was no longer able to manage Paratoo
                                station.  In 1930 the family moved to Gawler to seek medical treatment for his damaged limbs.
                                When they first moved to Bowden's Cottage from Gawler in 1931 it consisted of an old tent and
                                a one-room stone dwelling.  Despite the confines of the Cottage, it felt good to get out of
                                town and back into the open spaces surrounded by the bush, even if it meant cooking meals in
                                a camp oven over an open campfire.
                            </p>

                            <p class="left">
                                Iris could drive since she was 10 years old, back on the station, but when they moved
                                to Gawler/Barossa Goldfields she was considered too young. When her father became too sick
                                to drive, the Bowdens sold their car. Iris had to walk from Bowden's Cottage to Williamstown
                                or Gawler to get their supplies. She would walk to Gawler every Saturday and carry goods home
                                in a sugar bag.  It was a hard slog home up the Hutchinson Hill laden with goods.  Even when
                                the grocer from Williamstown began deliveries to their cottage, Iris still walked to Gawler
                                every Saturday for additional supplies.  Facilities for washing were primitive; Iris's
                                father bought an old copper for boiling the clothes in and built a little shelter over it
                                for protection.  Initially clothes were rinsed in buckets until an old trough was enlisted
                                for the task.  Despite the apparent hardships, Iris's mother never complained; although
                                appearing frail she was obviously a very strong woman.  She lived to be 96 and had a perfect
                                memory.
                            </p>

                            <p class="left">
                                When extensions to the cottage commenced, Iris and her father would spend one day
                                chipping stones to make bricks. The next day Iris would cart water and the sticky yellow
                                clay that would be used to bind the stone for the walls.  Iris used two kero buckets supported
                                by a yoke made for her by her father for carting the water.  Iris's father would tell her
                                to only half fill the buckets but Iris would always try to carry the buckets filled to the
                                brim to save time.  Once water and stone were collected the following day would be devoted
                                to building.  Both Iris and her father would be up early mixing clay and laying stone to build
                                the extra rooms.  Once the walls were complete, Iris was sent by her father to cut wood for
                                the roof – "got to have straight mallee, good and strong, no dog's feet" he would say.  She
                                had to cut away one side of each of the mallee lengths to straighten them for affixing the
                                roof to, often striking her ankle with the axe as she worked.  Once six or seven lengths of
                                mallee had been prepared she would then drag them back home in preparation for roof building
                                the following day.
                            </p>

                            <p class="left">
                                At the tender age of only 14 to 16 years, and with little help from her incapacitated
                                father, the effects of such heavy manual labour were to ultimately take their toll and today
                                Iris suffers considerably from back pain as a result.

                                Iris's father died when she was 20.  Iris Bowden married Norm Bain in July 1938
                                and continued to live in Bowden's cottage with her mother.  Iris and Norm had 3 children
                                - Gary, Rosemary and Monica.  Bain became sick and died when he was 50.

                                and used around 1885 – 1900 and is thought to have been moved to Williamstown around 1900 - 1910
                                as extra storage space for non law-abiding timber cutters.  The Timber Mill in Williamstown
                                commenced operations in the 1840's but probably benefited from an increase in timber cutting
                                activity in the early 1900's to meet the demands for building materials destined for the Port
                                Adelaide wharves and the railways.

                                Prior to it's current location next to our museum,
                                the cell was originally located behind the "old" Williamstown Police Station
                                which was sited opposite the Williamstown School until the 1950's.  It was then relocated to
                                the current (proposed to be sold) station around 1952? or 1957?  It was probably shortly after
                                this (1958 – 1959) that the concrete cell was built and the somewhat substandard corrugated
                                iron cell decommissioned.

                                The gaol cell has stood on this site since the 1950's.  Although many older locals
                                refer to it as the Old Barossa Goldfields Gaol Cell, little is known of its actual
                                history prior to its being relocated to Williamstown.  In December 1999, Barossa
                                Goldfields Historical Society (BGHS) Chairman, Bob Swarbrick was speaking to Senior
                                Constable Chris Gill of Williamstown Police when the topic of the Barossa Goldfields
                                Gaol Cell was raised.  Chris Gill mentioned to Bob that the Police Station was to be
                                closed and sold and asked whether the BGHS would like the old cell with a view to
                                returning it to the Goldfields.

                                The corrugated sides are removed and the rotted and white ant eaten timber support beams
                                are repaired and replaced.  The iron is trimmed and tidied and flashing is placed around the
                                base before the sides are nailed back in place.  The internal woodwork, including the flooring,
                                is repaired or replaced.  The old paint is removed with wire brushes and the whole cell repainted.
                                Wattyl paint colours are chosen: 'Colourbond Tuscan Red' for the roof and heritage colours
                                'Drab' for the walls, and 'Deep Brunswick Green' for the trim.
