                        <strong>Cockatoo Valley, South Australia</strong>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We're not far from the Whispering Wall, so if you're going past - why not drop in.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Bowden's Cottage is about 15kms from Gawler. Located 4kms up Goldfield Road. Directions from
                        various starting points are detailed below.
                    </p>
                    <h2>From Gawler (about 15km)</h2>
                    <p>
                        Head North along Murray Street in Gawler and turn right onto Barossa Valley Way. About 7km along
                        you'll find the Sandy Creek Hotel where you should turn right onto Williamstown Road. After
                        passing the Cockatoo Valley general store and petrol station (on the left) turn right onto
                        Balmoral Road and then immediately turn left onto Goldfields Road. Follow Goldfields Road
                        (which soon becomes unsurfaced) all the way to the end and turn left at the T intersection.
                        The Goldfields museum, picnic grounds and display is then on your right as you approach
                        Allendale Road. An off-street parking area is a short distance down Allendale Road near some
                        of the trail heads, and some parking is available at the side of the road near the museum.
                    </p>
                    
                    <h2>From Adelaide</h2>

                    <p>
                        Head out of the city along Lower North East Road for about 15km. At the end of Lower North
                        East Road turn right onto North East Road/B10/Torrens Valley Scenic Drive. Keep to North East
                        Road for about 8km, past Millbrook Reservoir and turn slightly left onto South Para Road/B31.
                        Continue along South Para Road, through Kersbrook, where the road changes name to Little Para
                        Road/B31. About 13km past Kersbrook, just before Williamstown, turn left onto Para Wirra Road.
                        After about 6.3km, the museum, picnic grounds and display is on your left as you approach
                        Allendale Road. An off-street parking area is a short distance down Allendale Road near some
                        of the trail heads, and some parking is available at the side of the road near the museum.

                    </p>
                    
                    <h2>From the Whispering Wall (about 7km)</h2>

                        Head out of Whispering Wall Park along Whispering Wall Road until you reach Yettie Road.
                        Turn left onto Yettie Road and then merge left onto Williamstown Road after about 1.2km.
                        Follow Williamstown Road for about another 1km and then turn left into Balmoral Road.
                        Immediately turn left onto Goldfields Road. Follow Goldfields Road
                        (which soon becomes unsurfaced) all the way to the end and turn left at the T intersection.

                    <p>
                        Head South along Murray Street in Nuriootpa and continue along Barossa Valley Way to Tanunda
                        and then to Lyndoch. At the main intersection in Lyndoch continue across past the hotel into
                        Gilbert Street and then on to Pimpala Road. Turn left at Williamstown Road, and proceed
                        past the Cockatoo Valley general store and petrol station. Turn right onto
                        Balmoral Road and then immediately turn left onto Goldfields Road. Follow Goldfields Road
                        (which soon becomes unsurfaced) all the way to the end and turn left at the T intersection.
